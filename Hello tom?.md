Hello tom?
Hello!

Prediction markets
    * Metaculus (https://www.metaculus.com/questions/)
        - Most professional. Requires long questions
        - Read: API
        - Write: API (maybe). Gonna need lots of boxes
    * Manifold (https://manifold.markets/home)
        - Simplest to write questions. Play money
        - Read: API (even I can do this)
        - Write: API (even I can do this)
    * Polymarket
        - Biggest PM
        - Read: Lets not bother
        - Write: Copy to clipboard to put in 
    * Zeitgeist
        - Crypto I have close time to
        - Read: Lets not bother
        - Write: Ideally copy directly to site, but that might take time

What to build
- A way to take a market from one site to another
    - Nathan sees as market on Manifold "If Trump is arrested will there be X casualties"
    - I wish I could bet money on this (bit ghoulish but bear with me)
    - Press a button
    - Create on Zeitgeist

Market:
- Question
- Resolution criteria
- Close date

Ideas:
- Move markets definitions from one platform to another
- Write and rate markets
